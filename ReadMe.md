# SOCAI 

Welcome to Socai! The best social media app for people who don't love social media. 

## A Social Media Content Creation and Scheduling App

This web application is built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) and leverages OpenAI's API to help users create social media content and schedules. The app features a single machine learning model that represents a social media post with the following properties: image, description, caption, hashtags, and date.

Users can input an image and description on the frontend, and then the AI generates a suggested caption, hashtags, and scheduled date for the post. Once the AI has finished creating the rest of the model, the post is added to the database and displayed on the frontend in an index of all scheduled posts. 

Users can view the individual details of a post and edit or delete it as needed.

Overall, this app aims to simplify the social media content creation and scheduling process for users, while leveraging the power of machine learning to suggest high-quality captions and hashtags.
